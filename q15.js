// How can I make use of Error Boundaries in functional React components?

// As of v16.2.0, there's no way to turn a functional component into an error boundary. The componentDidCatch() method works like a JavaScript catch {} block, but for components. Only class components can be error boundaries. In practice, most of the time you’ll want to declare an error boundary component once and use it throughout your application.

// Also bear in mind that try/catch blocks won't work on all cases. If a component deep in the hierarchy tries to update and fails, the try/catch block in one of the parents won't work -- because it isn't necessarily updating together with the child.

// A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines either (or both) of the lifecycle methods static getDerivedStateFromError() or componentDidCatch(). Use static getDerivedStateFromError() to render a fallback UI after an error has been thrown. Use componentDidCatch() to log error information.

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = { hasError: false };
    }
  
    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
      // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
      return { hasError: true };
    }
  
    componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
      // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
      logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
    }
  
    render() {
      if (this.state.hasError) {
        // You can render any custom fallback UI
        return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
      }
  
      return this.props.children; 
    }
  }
